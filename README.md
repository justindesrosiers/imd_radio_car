# IMD Radio Controlled Car
Interactive Media Development - Radio controlled car example
This is a repository for code pertaining to a radio controlled Arduino robot car.
The controller sends it's signal to the car via the RF24 radio transeiver module.

The first iteration of this car uses 4 DC motors and can only be steered by slowing the wheels slightly on one side to skid the car in a
particular direction.

## Contributing to the code base:
